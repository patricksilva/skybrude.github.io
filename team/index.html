      <h2>Elizabeth C. Matsui, MD</h2>
      <p><strong><em>Principal &amp; Co-founder</em></strong></p>
      <p>Dr. Elizabeth Matsui is a Co-Founder of Skybrude and an Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Epidemiology, and Environmental Health Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. She is a pediatrician, allergist-immunologist, and epidemiologist with more than 10 years of experience as the Principal Investigator of epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and has a primary research interest in the impact of environmental exposures on asthma.  Her work led to the identification of mouse infestation and exposure to mouse allergen as a major contributor to asthma in low-income children, and she now serves at the Principal Investigator of the Mouse Allergen and Asthma Intervention Trial (MAAIT), an NIH-funded, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of the effect of a mouse infestation intervention on asthma.  Dr. Matsui has authored more than 90 articles in the biomedical literature and has successfully competed for over $12 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health over the past 10 years.

In addition, Dr. Matsui directs the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) of the Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  The DMAC, which has supported dozens of studies, provides services including design of data collection tools, development of web-based applications for study management, data management and quality control activities, and data analysis.  Under Dr. Matsuiâ€™s leadership, the operating budget of the DMAC more than doubled in size and the technical and statistical capabilities were greatly expanded. 

Dr. Matsui holds a B.A. in molecular biology and an M.D. from Vanderbilt University, and an M.H.S. in Epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  She completed a pediatric residency at the University of California, San Francisco and a fellowship in Allergy/Immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

      <p><strong><em>Principal &amp; Co-founder</em></strong></p>
      <p>Dr. Roger D. Peng is a Co-Founder of Skybrude and an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. A faculty member at Johns Hopkins since 2005, his main research interest focuses on developing and applying novel statistical methods to assessing the health impacts of environmental pollutants. He is a Principal Investigator of the Medicare Air Pollution Study (MCAPS), which studies the health impact of air pollution on the elderly in the United States, and has developed some of the fundamental statistical methodology for conducting national studies of air pollution and health. With his team at Johns Hopkins, he pioneered approaches to linking massive administrative claims databases, such as from Medicare, to environmental monitoring networks to study the relationship between air pollution and morbidity. Through his research, Dr. Peng has successfully competed for over $3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health over the past 5 years.

He has authored over 70 peer-reviewed publications which have appeared in leading scientific and statistical journals such as Science, the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Dr. Peng is also a Co-Founder of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera. With his colleagues, he has enrolled over 1 million students in massive open online statistics courses. Through this unique course series, he has taught topics such as R programming, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, methods for conducting reproducible research, and developing data products. 

Dr. Peng has also taught numerous short courses on statistical methodology, data analysis, R programming, and reproducible research. He is a Co-Editor of the popular <a href="http://simplystatistics.org">Simply Statistics blog</a> where he regularly writes about scientific and statistical issues for a mass audience.

He holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Yale University and a Ph.D. in Statistics from UCLA. </p>
