title: Diagnostic epidemiology 102 – this s*t's getting real

Did you think my last blog post about the risks of the
direct-to-consumer diagnostic testing movement as exemplified by
Theranos [oversold things](http://skybrudeconsulting.com/blog/2014/12/12/diagnostic-testing.html)?
Was too abstract? Well, this story is for you.

Apparently, people are having abortions after getting positive
prenatal genetic screening tests without confirmatory testing because
[they and their doctors do not understand how to interpret diagnostic
testing](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/14/oversold-and-unregulated-flawed-prenatal-tests-leading-abortions-healthy-fetuses/aKFAOCP5N0Kr8S1HirL7EN/story.html). In
particular, they do not understand the difference between specificity
and positive predictive value. As I mentioned in my previous post
specificity is a measure of how often people without a disease will
test negative for it. But, if you’re the person with a positive test,
what you really care about is positive predictive value, which is the
likelihood that if you test positive you really have the disease. The
problem is that positive predictive values are dependent on how likely
you are to have the disease before taking the test. Unless your test
is virtually perfect, when screening for a very rare disease, most
positive tests are going to be false positives.

Let’s take an example with some math. Let’s say a test is 99% specific
("accurate") like the one mentioned in the
[article](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/14/oversold-and-unregulated-flawed-prenatal-tests-leading-abortions-healthy-fetuses/aKFAOCP5N0Kr8S1HirL7EN/story.html).
Let’s also say that the prevalence of the disease is 1/2,500
(estimated to be the prevalence of Trisomy 18). That means that for
every 10,000 people tested, 4 will have the disease.  To make things
simple, we’ll assume that all 4 people who have the disease test
positive. Because the test is 99% specific, 99% of the rest of the
people without the disease will test negative (good for them), but 1%
will test positive, which in this case is about 100 people (10000-4 =
9996, 1%*9996 = ~100).  Let that sink in: 100 people who do NOT have
the disease will have a positive test.

We can also calculate the positive predictive value, which is the
likelihood that a test is a true positive. Since 4 will have a
positive test and actually have the disease and 100 will have a
positive test but not have the disease, the positive predictive value
is: 4/(100+4) = ~4%, so that 96% of the positive tests will be false
positives. Even if the test is 99.9% specific, the positive predictive
value is still only 4/(10+4)=29%, and 71% will be false positives.

Bottom line: we need to be really careful about interpretation of
screening tests and educate patients, health care workers and the
public about their limitations. No one should be making a decision
about something like terminating a pregnancy based on misunderstood
screening tests.
