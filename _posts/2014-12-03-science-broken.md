title: Is Science Broken?

Recently I was talking to a colleague about whether one of his high
profile controversial scientific findings from a few years ago turned
out to be true. He said that there had been quite a few papers that
had accumulated since the discovery and he estimated that the "pro"
evidence outweighed the "con" evidence in about a 3:1 ratio, so it
seemed that the finding was probably true. Surely there must be a more
elegant way of finding the truth? Iâ€™d argue that despite the sometimes
frustrating nature of discovery, this is a sign that science is
working as it should. 

Although the press sometimes portrays the
back-and-forth of scientific discovery as a sign that the process is
broken, it is the very nature of the process that as more research is
done, conclusions change.  My colleague Roger Peng, for example, makes
this point <a

and discusses whether there is a crisis of lack of reproducibility in
science <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/?p=3377">here</a>. More
to come in this space on why some studies might get different results
and ways to improve the odds of finding a more true answer on the
first try.
