Our colleague Corinne Keetâ€™s recent finding that children with milk allergy may be at nutritional risk has been getting a lot of press:

This study is a great example of how existing publically available
data can be used to address important clinical questions.

For this study, Dr. Keet and her colleagues used [NHANES](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm), a survey done every year by the CDC, but there are many other [freely available sources of health data](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/).
