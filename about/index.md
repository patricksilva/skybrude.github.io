    <p class="lead">Skybrude Consulting, LLC is a boutique advisory firm
    that provides customized data science services to the health tech,
    non-profit, and social services sectors. We believe that tapping
    into the full potential of data depends on the right combination
    of data analysis tools and scientific thinking, and that the
    people behind the data are of critical importance.

    <p class="lead">There are a growing number of examples that
    highlight the importance of applying scientific expertise when
    analyzing data. The types of issues that lead to drawing the wrong
    conclusions from data analyses are relevant in all data analysis
    projects and are best addressed by a multi-disciplinary team with
    expertise in the scientific method.</p>

    <p class="lead">At Skybrude, our expertise in epidemiology,
    medicine, public health and biostatistics results in a
    scientifically grounded approach to data projects, so that your
    organization makes decisions based on the best possible
    information.</p>
